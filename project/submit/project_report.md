Good day my reviewer friend.

I try to do do a predictor.distill() but it fails and I try to reinstall it on my local environement.
It broke my local environment. And I am having trouble with the udacity provided cloude environment.
It stopped working for the past few weeks and I am trying to run it my own AWS but I have troubles with the kaggle
I will try to resolve it but for the mean time the code works more or less.
So I am just updating the report as above till I have an env to re-run it again with your recommendations...

-Thx for your support.
